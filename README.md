📌 Project Title:
Interactive Linked List Visualizer (Qt C++)

🧠 Description:
An interactive desktop application that visualizes and manages a singly linked list using a modern GUI built with Qt. The application allows users to insert, delete, search, and traverse a linked list dynamically. It provides visual feedback for every operation and includes additional features such as showing deleted items (trash), finding the second maximum value, and measuring the length of the list.

⚙️ Technologies Used:

C++

Qt Framework (Widgets, Layouts, Signals/Slots)

OOP & Templates for Data Structure

GUI Styling with QSS

🧪 Key Features:

Insert values at specific positions

Delete selected elements and view them in a “trash” section

Search for values and retrieve their positions

Find the second maximum value in the list

Get the current length of the list

Clear all items and reset the list

Styled, user-friendly GUI with shadow effects and dynamic labels

🎯 What I Learned:

Implementation of generic singly linked lists using C++ templates

GUI development with Qt (widgets, layouts, and signals/slots)

Error handling and user input validation

Designing interactive, responsive desktop applications

Integrating data structures into a visual interface
